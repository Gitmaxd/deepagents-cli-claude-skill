## Scope

This project is a documentation skill — it contains markdown reference files and a CLI installer. It does not execute user code, make network requests, or handle credentials. The primary security considerations are:

- **Supply chain** — the npm package and its dependencies
- **Installer behavior** — the CLI copies files to the filesystem without overwriting existing files
- **Skill content** — instructions that Claude follows when the skill is active
