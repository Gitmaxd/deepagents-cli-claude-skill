## Overview

The Deep Agents CLI is LangChain's terminal coding agent — a LangGraph-powered assistant with persistent memory, 20+ LLM provider integrations, sandboxed code execution, and a composable skills system. Its surface area spans interactive and non-interactive modes, a rich slash-command REPL, programmatic SDK customization, streaming output, and the Agent Client Protocol for editor integration.

This package scaffolds a [Claude Skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) that encodes that entire surface area as structured, on-demand knowledge. When the skill is active, Claude can accurately assist with any Deep Agents CLI task — from launching a first session to building production subagent pipelines — without requiring repeated context or pasted documentation. The skill works across all Claude surfaces: **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, and **claude.ai**.

The skill follows the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/) and loads automatically when relevant. It can also be invoked directly with `/deepagents-cli`.

---

## Why This Skill?

This isn't just a documentation reference. When your coding agent has this skill loaded, it can actively help you **work with deepagents** -- not just answer questions about it.

- **Learn by building.** Ask your agent to walk you through deepagents concepts, then have it set up a session, configure providers, or scaffold a skill -- all from within your current editor.
- **Author custom agents.** The skill includes the full SDK reference for `create_deep_agent()`, middleware, subagents, and backends. Your agent can help you design and implement specialized deepagents workflows tailored to your stack.
- **Extend deepagents itself.** Clone the [deepagents repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents), install this skill, and let your coding agent help you customize the framework -- adding tools, modifying behavior, or building production pipelines.

The skill covers everything from first launch to programmatic customization, so your agent grows with you.

## Installation

### Workspace (recommended)

Installs the skill into the current project's `.claude/skills/` directory. Check it into version control to share it with your team.

```bash
npx deepagents-cli-claude-skill init
```

### Personal

Installs the skill to `~/.claude/skills/` so it is available across all projects on your machine.

```bash
npx deepagents-cli-claude-skill init --personal
```

### Claude Desktop / claude.ai

If you use the Claude Desktop app or claude.ai (no terminal required):

1. Download `deepagents-cli-skill.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Gitmaxd/deepagents-cli-claude-skill/releases/latest)
2. Open Claude Desktop or claude.ai
3. Go to **Settings > Features > Custom Skills**
4. Upload the zip file

The skill works identically across all Claude surfaces. Requires a Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan with code execution enabled.

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--personal` | Install to `~/.claude/skills/` (personal scope) | `false` |
| `--path <dir>` | Target directory for workspace installation | Current directory |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation when skill directory already exists | `false` |
| `--help` | Show usage information | — |
| `--version` | Show installed version | — |

### Updating

To update the skill after a new release, re-run the init command. Existing files are never overwritten; only files added in the new release will be created.

```

The skill follows the [Agent Skills progressive disclosure model](https://agentskills.io/specification#progressive-disclosure): `SKILL.md` is the primary context loaded by Claude, and the reference files are surfaced on-demand as the task requires them. This keeps the token footprint minimal while making the full surface area available.

---

## Skill Resources

Each reference file is a structured knowledge document scoped to a specific area of the Deep Agents CLI. All content is sourced from the [official LangChain Deep Agents documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) and aligned with the documented API.

### SKILL.md

**Purpose:** Entry point for the skill. Contains a concise overview, quick-start examples, core concept summaries, and links to all reference files.

**Value:** Claude reads this file first when the skill is activated. It provides enough context to handle the most common tasks immediately and directs Claude to the appropriate reference file for deeper questions, keeping initial token usage minimal.

---

### CLI Reference

**File:** `references/cli-reference.md`
**Source:** [CLI Overview](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/cli/overview)

Complete reference for every command, flag, slash command, and keyboard shortcut in the Deep Agents CLI. Covers top-level commands (`deepagents list`, `deepagents reset`, `deepagents skills`), all launch flags (`-M`, `-a`, `-n`, `-r`, `-q`, `--auto-approve`, `--shell-allow-list`), all slash commands (`/model`, `/remember`, `/threads`, `/trace`, `/clear`, `/tokens`), keyboard shortcuts for the interactive REPL, the built-in tool inventory with approval requirements, and non-interactive mode behavior in detail.

---

### Providers and Models

**Source:** [Model Providers](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/cli/providers)

Configuration reference for all 20+ supported LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, Perplexity, xAI, OpenRouter, and more. Covers API key environment variables per provider, the `~/.deepagents/config.toml` schema in full, model resolution order (`-M` flag → config default → recent → API key detection), and provider-specific parameters for local models such as Ollama.

---

### Skills System

**File:** `references/skills-system.md`
**Source:** [Skills](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/skills)

---

### Agent Client Protocol

**File:** `references/acp.md`
**Source:** [Agent Client Protocol](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/acp)

## Agent Skills Compliance

This skill is built to the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) and the [Claude Code Skill specification](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter | `name`, `description`, and `compatibility` fields present; description written for accurate auto-invocation matching |
| Narrow, outcome-focused scope | Skill scoped entirely to Deep Agents CLI knowledge; single domain, single responsibility |
| Co-located supporting files | `references/` directory co-located with `SKILL.md` inside the skill directory |
| Progressive disclosure | `SKILL.md` is the primary context under 500 lines; reference files are loaded on-demand by topic |
| Flexible invocation | Claude loads the skill automatically when relevant; user can also invoke with `/deepagents-cli` |
| Personal and workspace scopes | `--personal` targets `~/.claude/skills/`; default targets `<project>/.claude/skills/` |
